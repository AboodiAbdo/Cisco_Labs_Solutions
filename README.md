# **My CCNA V7 Journey - Cisco Certified Network Associate**
Hello! Iâ€™m **AbdulRhman AbdulGhaffar**, and this repository marks the beginning of my journey with **National Telecommunication Institute (NTI)** in learning networking and cybersecurity. Here, I document solutions for Cisco labs with detailed explanations, aiming to share knowledge and provide practical solutions for students and professionals alike.my journey of learning and mastering Cisco's **CCNA V7** certification. This repository contains a collection of labs, configurations, and notes that I will apply and solve throughout my path to achieve this certification. I will break down the content into **3 semesters**, each focusing on different aspects of networking fundamentals. Every semester will contain lab exercises, configurations, and real-world applications to deepen my understanding.

## **ðŸ”¹ About the Repository**

This repository is dedicated to documenting and solving the labs and exercises from the CCNA V7 course. The course is divided into **three semesters**, and I will be solving and uploading the labs for each semester as I go along. Below is an overview of each semester and what it covers:

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Semester 1: Introduction to Networks**

In the first semester, we dive into the fundamentals of networking. This semester covers the essential concepts needed to understand how networks operate. Topics include:

- Introduction to networking
- TCP/IP model and OSI model
- IP addressing and subnetting
- Basic network devices: Routers, Switches, and their configuration
- Network protocols (e.g., DHCP, DNS, HTTP, etc.)

**Labs in Semester 1**:  
The labs will focus on configuring basic switches and routers, verifying IP addressing, and learning about network layer protocols.

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Semester 2: Advanced Routing and Switching**

Semester 2 takes networking to the next level by introducing more advanced topics such as routing protocols and deeper network design. Key topics include:

- VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks)
- Routing protocols: RIP, OSPF, EIGRP
- Subnetting in depth
- Switch configuration: Trunking, VTP, Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)

**Labs in Semester 2**:  
Expect to work on configuring VLANs, routing between different networks, and advanced troubleshooting techniques for networks.

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Semester 3: Network Security and Automation**

In the final semester, the focus shifts toward securing networks and automating network tasks using scripting. Topics include:

- Security concepts: Firewalls, ACLs (Access Control Lists)
- VPNs and encryption
- Automating network configuration with tools like Python
- Basic network troubleshooting and monitoring

**Labs in Semester 3**:  
Labs will cover securing routers and switches, configuring VPNs, and applying Python scripts to automate configurations.

---

## **ðŸ”¹ Practical Application of Labs**

As I progress through each semester, I will apply my knowledge to real-world scenarios by completing hands-on labs and documenting the steps. All the solutions will be shared on this repository, with detailed explanations and commands used to solve each task.

### **What to Expect**:
- **Detailed Lab Solutions** for each semester
- **Step-by-step explanations** of each task
- **Links to Cisco Packet Tracer files** for practical exercises
